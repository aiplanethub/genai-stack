## Motivation

The revolution of Large Language Models has sparked a monumental revolution in the field of AI, enabling us into a future of boundless possibilities. The global market for AI in enterprise and business is projected to skyrocket to an astonishing $2.8 trillion by the year 2030, ushering in an era of unprecedented growth. As more and more enterprises recognize the transformative potential of AI, they eagerly embrace its power, reshaping industries, and unlocking new frontiers of innovation. This revolution in return brings the risk of Data Privacy.

Yet, with every disruptive innovation, the uncharted territory presents both thrilling opportunities and puzzling unmet needs. The adoption of AI also conceals unknown risks, daring us to venture forth boldly while ensuring we remain vigilant to identify and mitigate potential pitfalls.
